I will be using this page mainly as a blog on my entry into the web development field, as a journal for my #100DaysOfCode challenge and notes and other things from the web development bootcamp I'm taking.

## Day 2: October 17, 2017, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Got through a load of my FreeCodeCamp making great progress. Finished the intermediate CSS section of bootcamp and met with client I'm designing a site for. Happy to report they're very happy with the structure and layout of the site so looking forward to receiving their content and loading the site up.

**Thoughts** Still very upbeat and feeling positive. The daily journal is a great way to think about the days events while charting progress. Having small daily achievable goals is the secret to creating creative momentum. I'm enjoying this so much and finding it such a benefit that I'm thinking of doing the 300Days of code challenge after this. Great community spirit in the challenges various forums 

**Today's Tasks**
- [x] Sort out my GitPage
- [x] Meet client about site
- [x] Work through my FreeCodeCamp
- [x] Bootcamp course work  

## Day 3: October 18, 2017, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: More of a laid back day today, Continued on with FreeCodeCamp and my bootcamp course. The next section is Bootstrap which I'm looking forward to. Caught up on loads of reading I wanted to do and lost far to much time on a fun little css game which I kept telling myself was all going to improve my css skills. Listened to a few of my favourite podcasts so happy with how the day went.

**Thoughts** The podcasts I was listening to today all seemed to have a general theme in regards to mindset. As web developers we will never know everything so It's so important learn a few core things and then become as much as an expert on those. You can often transfer the skills for one thing to another which seemed to make a lot of sense to me. I'm also finding a few benefits of the #100DaysOfCode challenge getting me into a routine which is making ticking off all my daily tasks possible again a skill that can be transfered to other goals. I'm liking how the GitPage is going I'm glad I went with the idea of using it more as a blog style and my journal entries it's a nice way of ending the day and is fast becoming one of my favourite times of the day. Now that my GitPage is developing I'm thinking for my next project to work on is a portfolio to show various projects.  

**Today's Tasks**
- [x] Work on my GitPage
- [x] Loads of reading mainly on CSS
- [x] Worked through my FreeCodeCamp
- [x] Worked on Web Development Bootcamp
- [x] Sketched out rough draft for a portfolio
