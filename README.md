I will be using this page mainly as a blog on my entry into the web development field, as a journal for my #100DaysOfCode challenge and notes and other things from the web development bootcamp I'm taking.

## 100 Days Of Code - Log

## Day 1: October 16, 2017, Monday

**Today's Progress**: Working through my FreeCodeCamp and then get some of my web development course done. Tonight I'll look into getting my GitPage sorted out and start designing that tomorrow.

**Thoughts** Feeling really positive about this challange. Looking to add to what im learning in my course while at the same time perfecting my skills. I'm thinking of developing a blog following my story into this totally new field while being a stay at home dad and all the adventures that entails....will think on that for a bit.

**Today's Tasks**
- [x] Sort out my GitPage
- [x] Push my commits to GitHub
- [x] Work through my FreeCodeCamp
