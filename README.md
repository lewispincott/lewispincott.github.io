## Welcome to my page 

I will be using this page mainly as a blog on my entry into the web development field, as a journal for my #100DaysOfCode challenge and notes and other things from the web development bootcamp I'm taking.

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/lewispincott/lewispincott.github.io/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
